# Spatial_Temp_Salinity_Moss_Landing
General guide to data: 
Using a YSI probe, we conducted a survey of Practical Salinity, Conductivity (mS/cm), Specific Conductance at 25°C (mS/cm), dissolved oxygen (mg/L and %sat) and temperature at 7 sites around Moss Landing. These sites were the Old Salinas River (upstream and downstream of the tide gate), Potrero Beach, Sandholdt Beach, Sandholdt Bridge, Snack Shack Bridge, and the South Jetty. These measurements were conducted between 1105 and 1213 hours on 31 August 2021, as the tide ebbed to low of 3.29ft at 1129 hours.
